# MPMB-UA22CS-Spells
Adds the spells from *Unearthed Arcana 2022: The Cleric and Revised Species* to the MPMB Character Sheets.

**Detailed List of Script Content:**
- Adds the following six spells:
  - Aid
  - Banishment
  - Guidance
  - Prayer of Healing
  - Resistance
  - Spiritual Weapon
- Also included is an alternate form of the **Prayer of Healing** Spell that has been modified to be in alignment with the updates to healing spells in *UA23PT8*; Changes made amount only to doubling the healing of the spell to 4d8+2d8/SL, with no other changes made.

**SCRIPT AUTHOR NOTE:** Though this script adds all of the spells in this UA article, due to the ambiguous state these spells are in regarding whether they are still in playtesting or not, all of the spells are set to be excluded by default. The user will need to enable the desired spells after adding this script to the sheet.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.

**Known Bugs:**
- No known bugs at this time. Will update when any are found.
